# chrome_ext_test

Simple chrome extension that allows you to count how many words and characters are in your highlighted text. Results show up automatically.

Can toggle on and off. 

Issues: 
 - Checkbox stays checked throughout pages, even if extension is not on for that page. Toggle on and off to fix this problem

 - Does not work when you select all with "ctrl+a" or "command+a". Only works for highlighted text. 

 Have a solution to the issues? Have a way to make the javascript files cleaner? Let me know! Please!
